# Weather Data Analysis

This project explores a weather dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and SQLite.

## Data Source

The weather data was downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ayushmi77al/weather-data-set-for-beginners).

## Data Loading and Exploration

- The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Basic exploratory data analysis is performed, including:
    - Displaying the head and tail of the dataset
    - Checking the shape of the dataset
    - Finding records with specific weather conditions
    - Calculating mean values
    - Filtering data based on multiple conditions

## Data Cleaning

- The dataset is checked for NULL values and handled accordingly.

## Data Transformation

- The mean value of each column is calculated for each weather condition.

## Data Storage

- The processed data is stored in a SQLite database for persistence.

## Usage

- Install the required libraries:
